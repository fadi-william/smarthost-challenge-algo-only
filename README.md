## How to run the project

1. Just make sure that you have Java and Gradle installed properly.
2. Run './gradlew runWithJavaExec'
3. That's all folks!

#### Notes

* The data model is not entirely used in this sample app (Hotel domain class, Customer domain class etc...) However, it is the model that I will rely on in the REST API Implementation using Spring Boot/Postgres.
* The ids of the domain classes are simple Strings for simplicity. In the Spring Boot project, I may use UUIDs or maybe auto-generated auto-incremented ids.
